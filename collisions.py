"""
Two objects of masses m1 and m2 move along a straight line and collide with each other.

Assuming that the collision is elastic, write a function that takes in the masses of the two objects m1 and m2 and their initial velocities u1 and u2, and return the final velocities v1 and v2 of the two masses.
